Assistance regarding Python

## What is this
1. Create a new folder?
2. Create a PR with example script and explanation what problem / question is

I'll try to research probelms and comment improvements.

## How
1. Clone the repo
2. Pull main branch
3. Create a new branch
4. Create a new folder and add a .py script and a README.md. You can also edit previous code created.
5. Push branch and create a PR for me to review.
6. We comment and discuss in PR or outside of it
7. When we have "solved" the problem we write a note of it in the README or in the script and commit.
8. We merge the PR and add that to the knowledge base :D
